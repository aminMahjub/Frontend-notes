MDN doc :

-Network lantency is the time it takes to transimt bytes over-the-air to computer

-Web performance is what we have to do to page load happen as quickly as possible

-Navigation is the first step of loading web page it occures whenever we send request by 
entering link into url box, clicking link, senging form data

one of the web performance goal is minize the time navigation takes to computers 
this does'nt takes too long, nut letancy and bandwidth can cuase delays

-the first step of navigation is DNS lookup when you searching website you send request to DNS and DNS send back the 
IP address as domain name 

we read about DNS and how it works in next chapter

-TTFB(time to first byte) is the time that user send request to server and the receipt of this
first packet of html, the first chunk of the contetn is usually 14KB of data

-the first respone pocket will be 14Kb and this is part of the TCP slow start, the alghoritm balances as speed connection of network
slow start incresees size of the amount data transmitted until the newtwork's max bandwidth can be determined

TPC slow start, after sending initial pocket, doubles the size of the next pocket around 28KB

-as the server send data in TPC pocket, clients confirm delivery data by acknowledgements,or ACKs
the ocnnection limmited in capacity dependiing on hardware and network condition, if server sends too many pockets quickly, they will dropped,
server registers this as missing ACKs, 

So congestion control algorithm uses this flow to determine data rate between send pockets and ACKs

-Once the chunk of data received, browser parsing it into the DOM and CSSOM and then show a page to screen

even initila pocket size is larger than 14KB thw browser bgin parsing and attempting to render the data it has 
so it's why important to web performance optimization to included everything browser needs to rendering

HTM and Css need to render first 

So before anything rendered to screen, the HTML and Css and JS hav to parsed

-first step of process of the html is building DOM tree, html parsing involves into tokenization and DOM tree
html token included start and end tags, attribute and name and values

when the parser find non-blocking resource such as image, first it send request to resource and continue parsing
the script tag without async or defer block process of parsin html
