The reasons why you must choose file's name with lowecase and no space name : 

1_ many computers almost web servers are case sensitive, for exmple you called one image with
test-site/MyImage.jpg and then in diffrenet file you invoke that image as test-site/myimage.jpg
it may not work

2_ many browsers and servers may not handle the space, for example if you put space between 
file name some browsers treat this files as two filename, or some servers replace spaces wit '20%'
and your links being broken 

Offer : it is better use - or _ for seprating the words
