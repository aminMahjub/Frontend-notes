Html basics important notes : 

- there is several text formatting :  
<b> - Bold text
<strong> - Important text
<i> - Italic text
<em> - Emphasized text
<mark> - Marked text
<small> - Smaller text
<del> - Deleted text
<ins> - Inserted text
<sub> - Subscript text
<sup> - Superscript text

- <b> just bold text without any importance
- <strong> this element bold the text with strong importnace
- <i> is used to alternative  voice and mood or you wanna write something from another 
language, technical terms, but by definition, no longer required to use this element, you can use font-style in css instead of

- <em> used for stressed emphasis compare to sourinding element 

- diffrenet betweem <em>, <i> : 
	resualt in web page is same but there is some diffrence in semantic meaning
	<em> element represents strees emphasis of its content but <i> element used 
	simple prose, such foregin word, fictional character or when one word refers
	to the definition of word insted of representing its semantic meaning
	for example 'just <em>do</em> it already' 'we <em>had</em> to do something'    
	when someone reading this notes would prononuce the words in italic with italic 
	emphasis, using verbal stress 

	example of <i> we can refer to "The <i>Queen Mary</i> sailed last night" there is
	no added emphasis or importance on the word "queen mary" another example is "The word
	<i>the</i> is an article"

	sometimes <em> indicate implict or explict contrast

	for example : 
	<p>
  		In HTML 5, what was previously called
  		<em>block-level</em> content is now called
  		<em>flow</em> content.
	</p>
