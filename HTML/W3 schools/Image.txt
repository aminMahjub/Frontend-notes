if you wanna create clickable area in you imaeg you can use <map> element and you can 
use <area> for marks up the area you want to be clickable

you must put attribute neamed usemap in you img element for find map and area 

for example : 

<img src="workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap">

<map name="workmap">
  <area shape="rect" coords="34,44,270,350" alt="Computer" href="computer.htm">
  <area shape="rect" coords="290,172,333,250" alt="Phone" href="phone.htm">
  <area shape="circle" coords="337,300,44" alt="Coffee" href="coffee.htm">
</map>

you must determined shape of you area and hten use coords for their coordinates 

we have 4 shape  : 

1_rect = rectabgular
2_circle = circular
3_poly = polygonal
4_default 

rect = you have four values as length and width of area first pair of number is first spot
on coordinates and second pair of number is second coordinates
 <area shape="rect" coords="34, 44, 270, 350" href="computer.htm">

circle = you have 3 values the firs pair of number is about spot in coordinates and third number is
radius

<area shape="circle" coords="337, 300, 44" href="coffee.htm">

poly : you can set many pair of numbre as x and y in coordinates example : 
<area shape="poly" coords="140,121,181,116,204,160,204,222,191,270,140,329,85,355,58,352,37,322,40,259,103,161,128,147" href="croissant.htm">


<picture> : use for show pictures with diffrente media screen 
for defined images you should use source element and give address in srcset, media attribute that defines when the image is the most suitable.
Always specify an <img> element as the last child element of the <picture> element. The <img> element is used by browsers that do not support the <picture> element, or if none of the <source> tags match.
for example : 
<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="img_food.jpg">
  <source media="(min-width: 465px)" srcset="img_car.jpg">
  <img src="img_girl.jpg">
</picture>

two reason for use picture element : 
1_bandwith of devices 
2_format support /l some browser don't support all formats 


for use favicon you can use <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/images/favicon.ico"> for sure
