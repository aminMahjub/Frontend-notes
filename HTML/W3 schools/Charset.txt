to display an html page correctly, the browser need to know which character set to use

ASCII : the first character standard, this standard has 128 characters , numbers (0-9)
Alphabets (A-Z), and some special characters like ! or %,<>
uses values form 0 to 31 to control the cahracters 
uses values from 32 to 126 letters or digigts and symbols


ISO-8859: default character set for html 4.0 this cahracter set support 256 diffrent cahracter
HTML 4 support UTF-8 too
ISO-8859-1 is identical to ASCII for the values from 0 to 127.

ISO-8859-1 does not use the values from 128 to 159.

ISO-8859-1 is identical to UTF-8 for the values from 160 to 255.


ANSI (windows-1252) : was the original character set for windows and it like ISO-8859 but 
this character set has 32 extra characters
uses 0 to 127 for contrl cahracters 
128 to 159 set of characters
and 160 to 255 like UTF-8 

and then utf-8 : support all symbols and character in the world
UTF-8 is identical to ASCII for the values from 0 to 127.

UTF-8 does not use the values from 128 to 159. 

UTF-8 is identical to both ANSI and 8859-1 for the values from 160 to 255.

UTF-8 continues from the value 256 with more than 10 000 different characters.

To set character you should use meta tag with charset attr : 
<meta charset="UTF-8">




URL Encode : 
url is another word for a web address 
url - Uniform resource locator

scheme://prefix.domain:port/path/filename

scheme - defines the type of Internet service (most common is http or https)
prefix - defines a domain prefix (default for http is www)
domain - defines the Internet domain name (like w3schools.com)
port - defines the port number at the host (default for http is 80)
path - defines a path at the server (If omitted: the root directory of the site)
filename - defines the name of a document or resource 

url can be sent only with ASCII character set if url contains character that is not 
support by ASCII it has to be converted

Url encoding replaces non-ASCII character with a "%"
